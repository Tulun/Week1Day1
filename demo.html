			<p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest.  Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her <strong>Little Red Riding Hood. </strong>

			One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother as it had been awhile since they'd seen each other.</p>

			<p>"That's a good idea," her mother said.  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.</p>
